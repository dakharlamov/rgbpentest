# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

- Username Enumeration
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1:

Vulnerability #2:

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

This vulnerability can be replicated by going into the login page for the green site and inputing both a real username and a bogus user name
with invalid passwords. You will notice a stylistic change on the site for usernames that are in the system versus invalid usernames. The
serverside html rendered uses a different class name for the css in the 'Log in was unsuccessful.' element. Valid usernames are bold whereas
invalid usernames are just regular emphasis.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

This vulnerability can be replicated by inserting a script tag into the Feedback section on the "Contact Us" page for the green site. When an
admin logs in to the admin view and checks the feedback for the site, the XSS script is automatically called.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

This vulnerability can be replicated by accessing the "Find a Salesperson" page on the red site
and inserting a ?id url parameter. In this case, ?id=10 lets any user view a user that is not
yet public.

Vulnerability #2:

## Notes

The challenge in this pentest was the shear number of permutations any of these vulnerabilities could have existed in within the three sites.
Given that many techniques require a large number of trials before any successful attack is discovered, this made the pentest time consuming
because we had to attack three sites.
